# Opening an issue

You've found a bug, want to contribute to the documentation, add a new feature or change an existing one? Ensure it was not already reported by searching in the repo under Issues. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. 
- Consider starting the title with the label of the solution your contributing to e.g. [TwinCAT] or [VISION]. Most of the solution names can be found as folders within the root.
- Be sure to include a clear description. You may want to do it in dutch if this is easier. In this way you're sure the issue is understood correctly.
- Add as much relevant information as possible and proof of the expected behavior that is not occurring.
- As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone.

# getting started

If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix. To do this you will need to:
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a new working branch
4. Start with your changes! Make as many commits as you wishes.
5. When you fixed an issue, create a PR. The teacher will decide which commits to keep/merge/delete

# Pull Request Requirements
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution.
- Include the relevant issue number.
- Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged.
